	Who am I?
	<br />
	I'm just a number, literally.  I can't tell you that number because I would be force choked until my head popped like
	a balloon. Believe me, I've seen it happen (RIP Bob). I'm just your average everyday Buckethead who puts his armor on one
	leg at a time.  I'm currently stationed on Death Star 2. Don't ask me about Death Star 1 (what a mess that
	was), "official" word is that it never happened so we will leave it at that.
	<br />
	<br />
	I was born on a mid rim planet to a poor family of moisture farmers.  At the age of 6 I was sold to the Empire for trooper
	training and have been with the trooper corp ever since. I've been trained in hand to hand combat, a little on blasters, and
	hope to start training with electrostaff's soon!
	<br />
	<br />
	My future goals are to find those pesky droids, just kidding, I know they're scrap heaps by now. I want to complete
	construction of my Sith saber and hitch a ride to the Outer Rim. Once there I will track down some Sith and beg to be
	trained in the ways of the dark side.
	<br />
	<br />
	Peace is a lie. There is only passion.
	<br />
	Through passion I gain strength.
	<br />
	Through strength I gain power.
	<br />
	Through power I gain victory.
	<br />
	Through victory my chains are broken.
	<br />
	The Force shall free me.
