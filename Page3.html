			<li>39,984 Stormtroopers died valiantly defending the Death Star.</li>
			<br />
			<li>Stormtroopers are superior in every way to Clone Troopers.  The empire did well phasing them out after
			the war.</li>
			<br />
			<li>There are almost a hundred different variants of Stormtrooper. Everything from specialists in radiation 
			filled environments to Dewback riders. From Scouts to pilots. From zero gravity specialists to riot control.</li>
			<br />
			<li>Stormtroopers who show signs of Force affinity during training meet the Grand Inquisitors and, provided 
			a series of criteria are met, are sent to Project Harvester. The only goal of Harvester is to 
			train Force sensitive individuals to better serve our glorious Empire, or so I am told.</li>
			<br />
			<li>A Stormtrooperâ€™s rank is indicated by a colour code on their left pauldron. Black was general enlisted, 
			white was sergeant and orange and red represented different levels of commander.</li>
